<p>The Groupware Weightlifting dataset is a set of 19662 observations by several weightlifters. The weightlifters
 were asked to perform their operations in one of five different manners while wearing tracking monitors. The 
purpose of this project is to use data from the monitors to predict in which manner the athlete performed the 
operation. The different manners of performing the operations make up the "classe" variable in the dataset. </p>

<p>The method chosen for this project was random forests, a method which consists of creating multiple decision trees 
from the variables in the dataset and comparing the various decision trees to determine the best predictors in the 
set. The variables which were present in all the test cases were used for building the model. Attempts to run 
random forests using the complete dataset exhaused the memory, so a subset of every tenth observation was used. 
Code for this operation is found in the attached RData file. The final result included 52 predictor variables. 
The relative importance of the variables is shown in Plot 1.</p>

<p>The final model had an accuracy of 0.904 and kappa of 0.878, so sample error should be about 10%. The model 
correctly predicted all 20 test cases. Plot 2 shows the relationship between the 8 most significant variables and
 the classes for the exercise movements.
